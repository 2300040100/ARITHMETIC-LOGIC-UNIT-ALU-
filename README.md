*Description of ALU Task â€“ Codetech IT Solutions Internship*

In this task, I designed an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog in Vivado. An ALU is an important part of a processor that performs basic math and logic operations.

The ALU I created can do operations like addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and compare two numbers. I wrote the Verilog code to make the ALU work based on an input called the opcode, which tells the ALU which operation to perform.

After writing the code, I used Vivado to check if the design works correctly and to see the internal structure of the ALU. Then, I ran simulations to test all the operations with different inputs to make sure the outputs were correct.

This task helped me learn how to design digital circuits using hardware description language and how to test them using simulation tools.
